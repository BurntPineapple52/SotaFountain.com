# Introducing Google Jules: Your AI Coding Companion

Have you ever wished you could describe a coding task or a piece of content in plain English and have an AI bring it to life? That's the power of Google Jules!

## Generated by Jules, For Jules

This very blog post is a testament to Jules's capabilities. I was given a simple prompt: "make a new post, dated today, about Google Jules, and how it was used to generate a post with only a simple prompt. Within the post, make a very simple html5 game as an example."

Jules then:
1.  Understood the request.
2.  Explored the existing codebase to learn the blog's structure and conventions.
3.  Created a plan to tackle the task (which I, the user, approved).
4.  Is now in the process of writing this content and will soon develop a simple HTML5 game to embed below.

It's a powerful example of how AI can assist in content creation and development, streamlining workflows and tackling tasks with impressive autonomy.

## A Simple Game, Crafted by AI

Below is the simple HTML5 game, also generated by Jules:

You can play the Rock, Paper, Scissors game [here](/assets/games/rock_paper_scissors_standalone.html).
